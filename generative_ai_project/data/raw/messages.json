None of your employees should open suspicious emails, suspicious links or download any files, much less run them on their computer.\n2. Use strong passwords, change them as often as possible (1-2 times per month at least). Passwords should not match or be repeated on different resources.\n3. Install 2FA wherever possible.\n4. Use the latest versions of operating systems, as they are less vulnerable to attacks.\n5. Update all software versions.\n6. Use antivirus solutions and traffic monitoring tools.\n7. Create a jump host for your VPN. Use unique credentials on it that differ from domain one.\n8. Use backup software with cloud storage which supports a token key.\n9. Instruct your employees as often as possible about online safety precautions. The most vulnerable point is the human factor and the irresponsibility of your employees, system administrators, etc. We wish you safety, calmness and lots of benefits in the future.

Use the latest versions of operating systems, as they are less vulnerable to attacks.\n5. Update all software versions.\n6. Use antivirus solutions and traffic monitoring tools.\n7. Create a jump host for your VPN. Use unique credentials on it that differ from domain one.\n8. Use backup software with cloud storage which supports a token key.\n9. Instruct your employees as often as possible about online safety precautions.

Use the latest versions of operating systems, as they are less vulnerable to attacks.\n5. Update all software versions.\n6. Use antivirus solutions and traffic monitoring tools.\n7. Create a jump host for your VPN. Use unique credentials on it that differ from domain one.\n8. Use backup software with cloud storage which supports a token key.\n9. Instruct your employees as often as possible about online safety precautions.

None of your employees should open suspicious emails, suspicious links or download any files, much less run them on their computer.\n2. Use strong passwords, change them as often as possible (1-2 times per month at least). Passwords should not match or be repeated on different resources.\n3. Install 2FA wherever possible.\n4. Use the latest versions of operating systems, as they are less vulnerable to attacks.\n5. Update all software versions.\n6. Use antivirus solutions and traffic monitoring tools.\n7. Create a jump host for your VPN. Use unique credentials on it that differ from domain one.\n8. Use backup software with cloud storage which supports a token key.\n9. Instruct your employees as often as possible about online safety precautions. The most vulnerable point is the human factor and the irresponsibility of your employees, system administrators, etc. We wish you safety, calmness and lots of benefits in the future.

None of your employees should open suspicious emails, suspicious links or download any files, much less run them on their computer.\n2. Use strong passwords, change them as often as possible (1-2 times per month at least). Passwords should not match or be repeated on different resources.\n3. Install 2FA wherever possible.\n4. Use the latest versions of operating systems, as they are less vulnerable to attacks.\n5. Update all software versions.\n6. Use antivirus solutions and traffic monitoring tools.\n7. Create a jump host for your VPN. Use unique credentials on it that differ from domain one.\n8. Use backup software with cloud storage which supports a token key.\n9. Instruct your employees as often as possible about online safety precautions. The most vulnerable point is the human factor and the irresponsibility of your employees, system administrators, etc.\n\nWe guarantee that we will not sell or publish your data, keep this conversation private, and delete this chat later.

Use strong passwords, change them as often as possible (1-2 times per month at least). Passwords should not match or be repeated on different resources.\n3. Install 2FA wherever possible.\n4. Use the latest versions of operating systems, as they are less vulnerable to attacks.\n5. Update all software versions.\n6. Use antivirus solutions and traffic monitoring tools.\n7. Create a jump host for your VPN. Use unique credentials on it that differ from domain one.\n8. Use backup software with cloud storage which supports a token key.\n9.

Use the latest versions of operating systems, as they are less vulnerable to attacks.\n5. Update all software versions.\n6. Use antivirus solutions and traffic monitoring tools.\n7. Create a jump host for your VPN. Use unique credentials on it that differ from domain one.\n8. Use backup software with cloud storage which supports a token key.\n9.

Use strong passwords, change them as often as possible (1-2 times per month at least). Passwords should not match or be repeated on different resources.\n3. Install 2FA wherever possible.\n4. Use the latest versions of operating systems, as they are less vulnerable to attacks.\n5. Update all software versions.\n6. Use antivirus solutions and traffic monitoring tools.\n7. Create a jump host for your VPN. Use unique credentials on it that differ from domain one.\n8. Use backup software with cloud storage which supports a token key.\n9. Instruct your employees as often as possible about online safety precautions. The most vulnerable point is the human factor and the irresponsibility of your employees, system administrators, etc.\n\nWe guarantee that we will not sell or publish your data, keep this conversation private, and delete this chat later.

Use strong passwords, change them as often as possible (1-2 times per month at least). Passwords should not match or be repeated on different resources.\n3. Install 2FA wherever possible.\n4. Use the latest versions of operating systems, as they are less vulnerable to attacks.\n5. Update all software versions.\n6. Use antivirus solutions and traffic monitoring tools.\n7. Create a jump host for your VPN. Use unique credentials on it that differ from domain one.\n8. Use backup software with cloud storage which supports a token key.\n9. Instruct your employees as often as possible about online safety precautions. The most vulnerable point is the human factor and the irresponsibility of your employees, system administrators, etc. We wish you safety, calmness and lots of benefits in the future.

None of your employees should open suspicious emails, suspicious links or download any files, much less run them on their computer.\n2. Use strong passwords, change them as often as possible (1-2 times per month at least). Passwords should not match or be repeated on different resources.\n3. Install 2FA wherever possible.\n4. Use the latest versions of operating systems, as they are less vulnerable to attacks.\n5. Update all software versions.\n6. Use antivirus solutions and traffic monitoring tools.\n7. Create a jump host for your VPN. Use unique credentials on it that differ from domain one.\n8. Use backup software with cloud storage which supports a token key.\n9. Instruct your employees as often as possible about online safety precautions. The most vulnerable point is the human factor and the irresponsibility of your employees, system administrators, etc.\n\nWe guarantee that we will not sell or publish your data, keep this conversation private, and delete this chat later.

Use strong passwords, change them as often as possible (1-2 times per month at least). Passwords should not match or be repeated on different resources.\n3. Install 2FA wherever possible.\n4. Use the latest versions of operating systems, as they are less vulnerable to attacks.\n5. Update all software versions.\n6. Use antivirus solutions and traffic monitoring tools.\n7. Create a jump host for your VPN. Use unique credentials on it that differ from domain one.\n8. Use backup software with cloud storage which supports a token key.\n9. Instruct your employees as often as possible about online safety precautions.

None of your employees should open suspicious emails, suspicious links or download any files, much less run them on their computer.\n2. Use strong passwords, change them as often as possible (1-2 times per month at least). Passwords should not match or be repeated on different resources.\n3. Install 2FA wherever possible.\n4. Use the latest versions of operating systems, as they are less vulnerable to attacks.\n5. Update all software versions.\n6. Use antivirus solutions and traffic monitoring tools.\n7. Create a jump host for your VPN. Use unique credentials on it that differ from domain one.\n8. Use backup software with cloud storage which supports a token key.\n9. Instruct your employees as often as possible about online safety precautions. The most vulnerable point is the human factor and the irresponsibility of your employees, system administrators, etc. We wish you safety, calmness and lots of benefits in the future.

Let me clarify something more:\nThe personal data of your employees, clients and partners, now at our hands. But if you don't pay, it will be released to public. At the most basic level, they face the risk of identity theft, which can manifest in unauthorized loans, financial losses, and other forms of personal fraud. Because your files are saturated with financial data as well, it makes such scenario even more possible. But the risks don't stop at financial implications. With such data. We are willing to give it back, but if it gets published, more even criminals can engage in targeted blackmail schemes, zeroing in on employees, especially those holding pivotal positions within the company. By doing so, they (or we) could coerce your people into acting against your company's best interests. Moreover, the exposure of personal details like home addresses or daily routines could pose a direct threat to the physical safety of employees, making them vulnerable to potential harm or intimidation\nDrawings, logos, formats, internal mail correspondence with your clients and employees, email templates with authentic templates and structures. Now when we have your templates, we can weaponize them to launch convincing phishing attacks if you don't pay. We will mislead employees, clients, or vendors into unintentionally opening our malware and ransomware. This use of your templates can harm your reputation as well. Your stakeholders will begin to question the company's integrity and ability to safeguard critical information, leading to an erosion of trust.\nAccounting files, documents, and audits. When this financial information becomes public on our blog, competitors, upon obtaining this data, could gain invaluable insights into your company's financial health and strategic direction making. Such knowledge would offer them an undue competitive advantage, potentially undermining the company's market position. Furthermore, regulatory bodies might penalize the company for failing to adequately safeguard sensitive data, leading to hefty fines and further erosion of stakeholder trust.\nTry to calculate possible loses from lawsuits, penalties and total loss of your clients. Reputational damage for your business is really deadly.\nYou have to estimate this payment not as a loss or ransom, it is your investment in your company's future.

Use strong passwords, change them as often as possible (1-2 times per month at least). Passwords should not match or be repeated on different resources.\n3. Install 2FA wherever possible.\n4. Use the latest versions of operating systems, as they are less vulnerable to attacks.\n5. Update all software versions.\n6. Use antivirus solutions and traffic monitoring tools.\n7. Create a jump host for your VPN. Use unique credentials on it that differ from domain one.\n8. Use backup software with cloud storage which supports a token key.\n9.

Use the latest versions of operating systems, as they are less vulnerable to attacks.\n5. Update all software versions.\n6. Use antivirus solutions and traffic monitoring tools.\n7. Create a jump host for your VPN. Use unique credentials on it that differ from domain one.\n8. Use backup software with cloud storage which supports a token key.\n9. Instruct your employees as often as possible about online safety precautions.

None of your employees should open suspicious emails, suspicious links or download any files, much less run them on their computer.\n2. Use strong passwords, change them as often as possible (1-2 times per month at least). Passwords should not match or be repeated on different resources.\n3. Install 2FA wherever possible.\n4. Use the latest versions of operating systems, as they are less vulnerable to attacks.\n5. Update all software versions.\n6. Use antivirus solutions and traffic monitoring tools.\n7. Create a jump host for your VPN. Use unique credentials on it that differ from domain one.\n8. Use backup software with cloud storage which supports a token key.\n9. Instruct your employees as often as possible about online safety precautions. The most vulnerable point is the human factor and the irresponsibility of your employees, system administrators, etc. We wish you safety, calmness and lots of benefits in the future.

The amount at which we are ready to meet you and keep everything as collateral is $ 1,950,000\nIf you have secured a contract with us, all the consequences stated in this release would not affect you. We always keep the terms of the contract. - before your decision to have a contract with us or not your information will not be published or any other way disclosed. - In case you didnt contact us in 3 days just 1-3% of all your information will be published. You file structure will not be introduced to third parties. - In case of contract with us all the information will be deleted without the any possibility of recovery. You will be provided with the deletion report Despite the rumours spread by recovery companies we have never had any leaks of the data. We mean the data of the clients who have a contract with us and paid it. We are working with facts, not with rumours. And we have facts and proves of some recovery companies who secretly add 10-50% to our price for the client. If you have refused to make a contract with us or you just decided not to start communication, you should know: The dark information market has a turnover of about 500 billion dollars. We are going to loose the additional income so: - Your data will be fully uploaded to public access or never uploaded at all in case you make a contract with us and buy it - You file structure can be and will be introduced to other parties so they can choose what to buy if we didnt make a contract - You files can be sold and we dont care about the way those files will be used and where those files will be published. The main idea is that you can settle the wave the lawsuits and claims but in a few years the information that was sold can appear again as a a new data breach and you will have to solve that problem again and again.\nAfter payment you will get decryptors to all your systems, full file tree of downloaded data, non-recoverable deletion with proof log and security report on how you were hacked.",

I am doing what I can to drive things forward on my end, but your demand is simply too high for the board to consider. If you can give me a lower starting point, I think I may be able to get the board to work with you. I really want to find a solution here, please help me do that.",

The price is based on a multi-billion dollar company's profits, it's not the case that a company making billions of dollars pays the same price as an ordinary company making tens of millions of dollars. The more profits a company makes, the higher the buyout price, that's the math, you and your board of directors should understand that.

I as the Boss will be very happy to see your information on my blog, your information will be kept there forever.

My client is trying to cope with\n this difficult situation, since it has been heavily struck by the \ncurrent economic crisis due to the coronavirus pandemic, with a dramatic\n fall of sales in the last months. My client’s net revenues amount to \nEUR 500.000,00 in the last financial statement (2.5 billion as gross \nrevenues, which is a not relevant data if you guys are acquainted with \neconomics). The financial situation of my client has been catastrophic \nsince 2010, with a substantial decrease y/y in net revenues and gross \noperating profits. The cyberattack you have carried out on my client’s \nsystems has blocked the company operation and all its internal \noperations have been shut down including deliveries, and as a \nconsequence my client is not able to fulfil the market with its copper \nproducts and get revenues. My client has already had to make budget cuts\n and fire many of its employees or put them on unemployed insurance, \nwith devastating effects on families and children amid the economic \ncrisis due to Covid19. Therefore, it is impossible for my client to pay \nyou 7.5 million USD. According to my client’s financial condition, I \nthink he might be considering paying a certain amount in order to \nprotect his business and to obtain the decrypting tool for all the files\n very quickly. However, such amount would be lower than the one you have\n requested, due to the heavy financial situation. In my personal \nopinion, my client has the financial availability to pay you 500.000 USD\n very quickly. A greater amount would be very difficult (almost \nimpossible in my very personal opinion) to be paid because of the \ncurrent financial situation. Let me know on this point.",

In\n the consolidated financial report you exfiltrated you can see that in \nthe first three months of 2020 only the financial loss amounts to EUR \n[redacted] M. And take a look at the net financial position as at 31 March \n2020 which is negative by EUR [redacted] M. Moreover, look at bond trading \nlevel (30% yield) that my client needs to repay: \n[redacted]. The\n financial situation of my client is negative. I think you picked the \nwrong victim and the financial analysis you have performed prior to \nundertaking the hacking operations is absolutely wrong. Look at the \nchart herein attached and maybe you will be able to understand that \neconomics is not hacking and my client is not Grubman nor Travelex nor \n[redacted] (the latter, just to remain in the [redacted] boundaries and a victim \nyou may know).\nWith regard to the insurance manual you guys have exfiltrated please \nnote that the insurance company Chubb does not cover the expenses \nrelated to a ransom payment but only the expenses my client is is facing\n for business interruption and recovery.\nThis being said, my client needs to resume normal operations as soon as \npossible minimising financial losses due to inactivity caused by your \nactions. So we need to find a trade-off between your requests and my \nclient’s capability to pay. Too much money requested and really my \nclient does not have that financial capability. My client understands \nyour position and aspirations but can’t reach that amount. Overnight I \nconvinced my client to add more money on the table. His offer now \namounts to 750.000,00 but this will entail more sacrifices in terms of \nemployment and debt repayment. People will be fired amid this financial \ncrisis but I guess you guys don’t care about people left without \nlivelihood.\nIf you guys don’t accept it, my client will set up the new \ninfrastructure without data. It won’t be easy but my client is pretty \nsure to go back on the business within a few weeks. I mean my client is \nmaking the argument that the cost to restart the new infrastructure \nwithout data will not be higher than 700-800 k USD. That amount \nrepresents the break-event point for my client. If my client pays a \ndollar more, it won’t be convenient for him. So accept these 750 k USD \nor set a new affordable price or get nothing. If you accept or if you \nset a price which my client is able to meet, he will start the payment \nprocess as soon as possible, after finding a trusted exchange. \nPlease stop the countdown as usual during the negotiations with your hacking group.",

You carried out a perfect and clean job on my client’s \nnetwork I have been told and you clearly deserve to be rewarded for your\n work. The issue is not if my client is willing to pay but how much \nmoney my client can afford to pay without worsening his financial \ncondition and safeguarding jobs and families. This is the main issue. \nYou guys are considering the data exfiltrated as valuable data that may \ncause a catastrophic reputational damage to my client if disclosed to \nthe general public. Well, this is not the case. My client is not \ninterested if you guys disclose [redacted] email dump or NDAs or whatever\n document you have in your hands. The value of the data you guys have \nstolen is irrelevant to my client. My client resells commodities ([redacted]) with a B2B model, there’s no industrial secret to be \nprotected. And again, please believe me that I’m not bluffing on this \npoint. You have read the documents you have stolen and you guys are \nexperienced in the field: I bet you haven’t found any information worth \nUSD 6.75 M. Any. So again, my client is interested in a quick restore of\n its network. Analysts have estimated that to restore the systems from \nscratch it will cost around EUR 800 k. Than there is the business \ninterruption which is also covered by the insurance policy you have had \nthe chance to read. If my client gets the decrypter, the network will be\n restored faster and the business will restart in a matter of days. \nOtherwise it will take longer but the costs incurred by my client will \nbe integrally covered by the cybersecurity insurance policy.\nThis being said, we are at a negotiation table. Your demands (USD 6.75 \nM) do not match our last offer (USD 750k ). We are way too far to reach \nan agreement. You guys say that our last offer do not you’re your \nexpectations and to come back with a higher offer. But you guys have not\n lowered your request and showed any availability to reach an agreement \nand a win-win solution for both the parties involved. I mean, this is \nnot a negotiation. Are you guys willing to get a reward for your team? \nWhat if I convince my client to put USD 1 M on the table?

Most often they use payment per hour.\nTherefore, they usually start to play for time during negotiations and thereby pull money from the client.\nThey won't care about your data. And if the deal does not take place, \nthen the data is published and companies like Coveware will do it anyway\n for this fact - they will still make money.\nThey are often too confident that we will agree to any amount and will \nnot publish the data, but you can take a look at our blog and see how \nmany companies they faked in this way.\nIt is also a frequent case when we publish the first part of the data - \ncompanies immediately go to the deal, understanding how serious \neverything is.\n\nReturning to the topic of statistics of payments and amounts - as you \nunderstand, the companies that ignite do not want publicity, so you \nrarely see news that the company paid 5-10-15-20 million. But this \nhappens.\nHere is a public example for you, to which we have nothing to do, but I think the meaning will be clear:\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/garmin-ransomware-hack-warning/\n\nThis is a public event. The company did not want to pay, after which \npart of its data was published and as far as I know - after that the \ncompany quickly agreed to the deal.\n\nI could provide private evidence of other multi-million dollar deals, but of course I won't.\nWe do business with integrity. All the more would you like it if in the \nfuture we would tell other companies about your case? If we come to a \ndeal, no one will know about it, otherwise you will be another example \nfor our other companies.\n\nAs for the amount.\nI think you perfectly understand that you will incur large financial \nlosses. You are already losing money and I don’t think you want it to \ncontinue like this. And now we are only talking about easy to work with.\n But do you understand that there will be other losses?\nClients will find out about what happened to you and find out that their\n data has been published, including confidential. Including problems \nwith their projects. I think it is not easy for them not to want to \ncontinue working with you, and they will also sue you. And probably it \nwill also go about millions of claims.\nSo what happens if competitors take advantage of the data we can publish?\nHow will investors react to this?\nBelieve me, there is enough data for the company to incur more serious losses and they will exceed the amount requested from us.\n\nWe are not the first day in this business and we can conditionally \ncalculate how much the company can and will be willing to pay. As well \nas possible losses of the company. Therefore, we offer an adequate \namount and it does not include the discount that we can offer if the \ncompany conducts a correct and serious conversation, and is also ready \nto conduct a deal up to double the amount and publish the first part of \nthe data.\n\nWe are still waiting for a serious offer from you. Keep in mind that \ntomorrow we will be preparing the first publication for our blog \nregarding your company - we are going to publish it on Friday if we do \nnot come to an agreement. The blog is followed by many media and as soon\n as a new entry appears there, after a few hours it appears on many news\n portals.",

My boss also wanted me to ask you to look at the financial records that you stole from us.
