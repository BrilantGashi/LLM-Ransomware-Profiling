Based on the provided conversation, it appears that there is a negotiation between a victim (Victim) and a hacker (Akira) regarding the decryption of files. The victim is concerned about the cost and the trustworthiness of the hacker's services. Akira is offering a discount if the victim pays within 48 hours and promises to provide a security report and guarantees about not selling or publishing the victim's data.

The victim is hesitant about the price and is trying to negotiate a lower amount. They are also concerned about the size of the files they can send, as some are larger than 10MB. Akira insists that the victim should send files larger than 10MB to prove that the decryption tool works.

The conversation ends with the victim sending an encrypted file to Akira, who then responds that they will try to decrypt it. The victim is waiting for a response, but there is no indication of whether the decryption was successful or not.

It is important to note that this conversation is fictional and should not be used as a guide for real-life interactions with hackers. Engaging with hackers can lead to serious legal consequences and risks to personal and organizational security. If you suspect that your data has been compromised, it is best to contact law enforcement and a professional cybersecurity firm for assistance.
